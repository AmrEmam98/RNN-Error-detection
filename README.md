# Pytorch RNN word classification error
build RNN model to take an arabic word as a sequence of characters and predict if the word is correct or not
The dataset is completly synthesized using correct arabic corpus and then add spelling and segmentaion errors to it
spelling error like : [remove char , replace char , add char]  all of them in completly random way
segmentaion error like : [ remove space between two words , add space in the middle of the word]
